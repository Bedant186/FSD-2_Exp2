# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Learning Outcomes
After completing this experiment, the learner will be able to:

- We have seen the implementation of SPA and its various components in exp-1 and exp-2. In this exp-3, we have used various components from react-router-dom package.
- Implement **client-side routing** using React Router
- Learnt to use components like BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link
- Create and manage multiple React components
- Use **Link** and **Routes** for navigation without page reload
- Build and deploy a React application using **Vite**
- Generate a production build using `npm run build`


---

## Conclusion
The use of this various react-dom components, it was possible to achieve navigation to various components using only one html page load.


## Result
The Single Page Application was implemented successfully with the afforesaid components to be used.
